Sorry about the late assignment - I was feeling ill all weekend and didnt finish in time. No excuse, and it wont happen again.

I had a bit more trouble with this assignment than any of the others we did. I think my problem was trying to edit the index and style sheets that I used for the last assignment instead of starting fresh. Went through a couple versions before getting this one to work. The only lingering issue I had is the spacing between the main column and the aside column - I wanted less space between the two but for whatever reason nothing I tried was working. Would love some feedback on that.
Otherwise, things went well. Glad that the class is starting to pick up and enjoying the challenge so far.
